## Assignment

1. Write a simple code (as you would do with C/Fortran) to solve the equation of a simple pendulum.
2. Rewrite the code making use of NumPy arrays.
3. For both cases show your results using plots and tables. Compare the results in terms of execution time. You are free to choose he parameters for your pendulum.

> Note: In class, we will learn the most simple content needed in order to start... Anyway, as part of your extra activities you may want to read and practice more by doing the exercises from chapters 1 and 2 from: <https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/>
